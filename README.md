# OldPhonePadApp 

This is a simple C# console application that decodes numeric input based on an old mobile phone keypad layout. It supports multi-press characters, pauses, backspaces, and input termination â€” simulating how texting worked on pre-smartphone devices.

---

## Features

- Converts key sequences to uppercase characters (e.g. `2` = A, `22` = B).
- Handles:
  - Spaces (` `) as **pauses** between key presses.
  - Asterisk (`*`) as **backspace**.
  - Hash (`#`) as **send / end**.
- Continuous input loop until user types `exit`.
- Input validation (must end with `#`).
